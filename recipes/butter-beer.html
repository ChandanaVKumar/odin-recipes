    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Butterbeer, from the Harry Potter book series, is described as foamy, spicy, and creamy. <br> The culinary team at Universal Orlando spent two years researching and developing the (closely guarded) recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice</li>
        
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons butterscotch topping</li>
        
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        
        <li>6 (12 ounce) bottles cream soda</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Freeze 6 mugs or pint glasses until icy, at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, for whipped topping, beat together cream,<br> cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form. <br>dd butterscotch topping and lemon juice; beat again until soft peaks form. </p></li>
        <li><p>For each butterbeer, pour 1 can cream soda into a mug; top with about 2 tablespoons whipped topping. Serve immediately.</p></li>
